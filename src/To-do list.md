# Stuff to fix / add

- ADD A 1 TICK DELAY BETWEEN DESPAWN->RESPAWN CYCLES. store handler and cancel in case of early despawns (and don't queue/spawn again)

- use spawn animations in list elements, actually animate scrolling with y scale changes

- fix FrameworkLib (or fancyplayershops? i have no idea) stopping block replacement actions (creative-only. the left+right click)

- Add options to FrameworkLib to make HUDs clien-side only (server-side elements, client-side display entities)
  - use this in FancyPlayerShop

- Limit hover events distance. players shouldn't be able to hover on stuff thats too far away. add a max distance config setting

- add ae2 compatibility
  - let players craft higher tiers of shop that can contain more stock
  - shops don't pull any item by default but require manual restocking.
    - Crafting them with an interface and a controller allows them to pull items from nearby inventories, or something annoying like that
  - each tier can become wireless by crafting it with a wireless transmitter

- add shop setting to change HUD distance
- add shop settings for click and scroll sounds (scrollable volume bar, mute with volume == 0)
- add shop setting to send everything to the stash, skipping the inventory
  - replace hand written inventory checks and calls with a generic give() method that checks for this option and also adds extra items to the stash

- add an undo command & chat message click command to undo item buy actions
  - add undos for shop deletion too. moving a shop doesn't need undos
  - add undos for shop transfer
  - make undos expire after the next undoable action or after 5 seconds

- Restrict shop placement to the owner's claims (Open Parties and Claims mod compatibility)
  - do something about ownership transfer, idk if it would bypass this or what
  - placing on chunk borders should be fine. you can already place ae2 components on claim borders, why not shops?
  - limit pulls to inventories players can access in survival, be that manually or through other mods.
  - e.g. don't pull from locked chests or creative storage blocks or other similar stuff
  - no idea how to check for this

- make the sliding in text auto scroll possible to turn off. call it "smooth text scrolling" or something

- add commands that let you change every setting. maybe from FrameworkConfig?
- add a /reload command. auotmatically generated by frameworkconfig too
  - add a onConfigReload() callback

- fix ae2 cells stacking for some obscure reason??? they shouldn't stack.

- add options in the edit menu to not check for NBTs.
  - this will let the shop pull any item with matching ID
  - add a disclaimer for buyers or an icon that clearly shows you can get any NBT
    - "..., which might include energy, item variations, custom names, and other data. Buy at your own risk!"

- add shop group display/input in the edit UI

- cache text and fancytext value width and height.
- update them on Text change

- Fix items not showing their type or data in the name:
  - tipped arrows
  - some spawners?
  - enchanted books [Custom behaviour, vanilla doesn't show the name]
  - banne patterns [Custom behaviour, vanilla doesn't show the name]
  - music discs [Custom behaviour, vanilla doesn't show the name]
  - smithing template [Custom behaviour, vanilla doesn't show the name]

- "top shops" list that shows the shops that made the most money in the specified timeframe
  - This is separate from the list of groups in the main menu. you access this from the stats
- "best customers" list that shows the players that spent the most money in the specified timeframe
  - This is separate from the list of groups in the main menu. you access this from the stats

- add a bar at the left of HUDs that shows how long is left until they despawns

- add performance options to skip unimportant animations and hide item displays when the TPS goes below certain thresholds

- allow players to transfer entire shop groups

- add Jade mod compatibility
  - Show a nicer name when the player looks at UI elements
    - add an overridable method that returns a name for jade
  - Show a nicer name when the player looks at shop item displays
    - use the overridable method that returns a name for jade

- add a system to preorder items
  - you can buy in advance and your items will be sent to the stash as soon as they are available in the shop block
  - you get a refund if the order is not fullfilled within a specified amount of real life days (only missing items)

Cleanup:
    - add @NotNull and @Null to everything
    - Check and/or add documentation comments to all methods and classes. use <p> to separate paragraphs (have it be on its own line)
    - delete commented code
    - complete todos and fixmes
    - remove spaces between if, for, while, do, else and (
    - use a single space between ) and {
    - Make sure that final variables, members and parameters are actually declared as final
    - check protection level of all members and methods
